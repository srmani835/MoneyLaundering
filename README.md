## Problem statement:

Given a financial transaction dataset, we have to identify the fraudulent transaction happening and take preventive measure for the same.

## Proposed solutuion:

We built an AI system which will be able to capture a fraudulent transaction based on the transactions present. We will focus on reducing both the False positive and False negative 

## Data Description:

Dataset was taken from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ealaxi/paysim1

  * There are total 11 columns and 6362620 records
  * It is a PaySim simulation synthetic dataset based on a sample of real transactions extracted from one month of financial logs from a mobile money service 
  * This synthetic dataset is scaled down 1/4 of the original dataset
